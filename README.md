Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing attention by the pervasive computing research community (see picture below, that illustrates the increasing number of publications in HAR with wearable accelerometers), especially for the development of context-aware systems. There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises.

Human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities. However, the “how (well)” investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har).

For the prediction of how welll individuals performed the assigned exercise six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

This report aims to use machine learning algoritmhs to predict the class of exercise the individuals was performing by using meaurements available from devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit.
